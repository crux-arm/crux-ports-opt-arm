README for Java SE Development Kit 7

REQUIREMENTS

   Download the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) from
   - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

   (For now the last JDK release available for ARM is version 7u10, so
   look for 'Java SE Development Kit 7u10' section in that page)

   and put the file
   -  jdk-7u10-linux-arm-sfp.tar.gz

   into the directory defined by PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR. See pkgmk.conf(5).
